# WebDevTutor - Project Brief

## Project Overview

WebDevTutor is a Next.js-based learning platform for webdev, featuring interactive coding challenges, progress tracking, and comprehensive learning paths. The platform provides a structured learning experience with theory, pseudocode challenges, and practice problems across multiple learning tracks.

## Current Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Core Features Implemented

- ✅ **Next.js App Router** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Shadcn UI** components for modern, accessible interface
- ✅ **NextAuth.js** integration with Google provider (placeholder setup)
- ✅ **Interactive Learning Flow** for multiple subthemes
- ✅ **Code Execution Environment** with client-side evaluation
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** using localStorage
- ✅ **Responsive Design** across all pages
- ✅ **Multiple Learning Tracks** (Data Structures, Problem Solving)

### Learning Flow

1. **Home Page** → Welcome and theme selection
2. **Theme Group Page** → Learning path selection with subthemes
3. **Learn Page** → Theory, visualization, and implementation
4. **Pseudocode Challenge** → Interactive IDE for algorithm practice
5. **Practice Problems** → Real-world problems with test cases
6. **Progress Tracking** → Visual completion indicators

### Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI with custom components
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google provider
- **State Management**: React Context for auth and progress
- **Code Execution**: Client-side JavaScript evaluation (MVP)
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage for progress tracking
